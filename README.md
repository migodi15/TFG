# Final Degree Project: Picard's Theorems

Final Degree project created with LaTeX in 2020. 

"In 1880 Emile Picard published the article <i>Mémoire sur les fonctions entières</i>, in which he presented two theorems that spoke about the image of analytic functions. These two theorems, today, are known as Picard's theorems, or more specifically, as Picard's Small Theorem and Picard's Theorem.
One of the forerunners of Picard’s theorems is the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem, which states that the image of a holomorphic function near a
essential singularity is dense in C.
Picard's theorems substantially improved what was previously known about the image of analytic functions. They were a revelation in their time and caused a great interest in Functions Theory [...]."
